# Fish Weight Prediction

This project is a Fish Weight Prediction application deployed on Heroku. The application allows users to predict the weight of a fish based on its measurements. The project is implemented using Python, Flask, and a pre-trained machine learning model.

## Live Application

You can access the live Fish Weight Prediction application using the following link:

## How it Works

The Fish Weight Prediction application uses a pre-trained machine learning model to predict the weight of a fish based on the following measurements:

- LengthVer: The vertical length of the fish.
- LengthDia: The diagonal length of the fish.
- LengthCro: The cross length of the fish.
- Height: The height of the fish.
- Width: The width of the fish.

To predict the weight, simply access the live application and enter the fish's measurements in the provided input fields. Click on the "Predict Weight" button, and the application will display the predicted weight of the fish based on the provided measurements.

## Usage

1. Access the live application using the link provided above.

2. Enter the fish's measurements in the respective input fields.

   - LengthVer: [Enter the vertical length]
   - LengthDia: [Enter the diagonal length]
   - LengthCro: [Enter the cross length]
   - Height: [Enter the height]
   - Width: [Enter the width]

3. Click on the "Predict Weight" button.

4. The application will use the machine learning model to process the input and display the predicted weight of the fish.

## Deployment

The Fish Weight Prediction application is deployed on Heroku, a cloud platform for hosting web applications. The live application is accessible using the link provided above.

## Disclaimer

This application is for demonstration purposes only and may not provide accurate weight predictions for real-world fish. The machine learning model used in this application is based on sample data and may not generalize well to all fish species.
